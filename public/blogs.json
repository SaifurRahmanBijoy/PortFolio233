    "detail": "𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐬:Valuable experience: The goal of any internship is to earn valuable, business-world experience. You will undoubtedly learn more than you set out to.Relevant field: An internship isn’t just like a high school job. Internships are chosen based off your career interests, which means you’ll be working in a field relevant to your long term aspirations. College credits: Many internship opportunities can offer college credits in return for work–so even if you’re not getting a paycheck, you are still getting paid indirectly. Networking: An internship is an ideal place to network. By connecting with your coworkers, supervisors, and any other contacts you might make while working, you open up many doors of potential opportunity. 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐬: It’s unpaid: Well, let’s start with the first and most obvious downside: you don’t get paid. You’ll be putting in a lot of time and hard work into your internship, and having a monetary reward would be nice. Lack of financial experiences: On top of not earning a paycheck, you’re not necessarily earning the financial experience that goes along with a steady income. Inequality: You’ve heard all the stereotypes about the intern: they fetch the coffee, are the brunt of office jokes, and are the lowest on the rung. Grunt work: It can be tempting for workers to dump all of the tedious, menial tasks onto the intern, especially an unpaid one. You will do lots of meaningful work as an intern, but some of the responsibilities you’ll get will be mind-numbing things below your skill level. It’s just a truth to face."

    "date": "1 January, 2023",
    "detail": "Web development in 2023 is not as easy to break into as it once was. Low-cost outsourcing is more prevalent, making it difficult for freelancers and web development agencies to secure long-term agreements. Competition for jobs, especially for new graduates, is tougher than ever. Web developers often face sleepless nights and immense stress due to demanding projects and tight deadlines. The constant need to learn new skills and adapt to changing technologies adds to the challenges. Communication issues between developers and non-developers can lead to dissatisfaction. Despite the difficulties, web development remains a challenging profession, requiring resilience and continuous growth."
